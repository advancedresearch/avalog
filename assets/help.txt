=== Avalog Help ===
Made by Sven Nilsen, 2020

Avalog is based on the theory of avatar extensions in path semantics:
https://github.com/advancedresearch/path_semantics/blob/master/sequences.md#avatar-extensions

Special commands:
- bye                 quits the program
- prove <expr>        prove a goal
- import "<file>"     imports an Avalog file
- clear               clears all facts
- echo <expr>         prints out debug format of expression

Type in an expression in avatar logic, e.g. `(a, q'(b))`
